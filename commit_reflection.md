Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
Throughout the development of my website tracking it through Commits is a bit difficut. Althought at the begging it is quite feasable to track what I am doing, in the middle and end one has no clue what I am doing. This is due to the lack of specific of labling I did. 
How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
My commit messeges do not clearly communicate what I was doing. This is due to the particular reason that in my commits I just immidately pressed do a commit or when there was no messege I just typed two random characters which had no correlation to my task. I should try to implement messeges and notes in my commits next time in order to have my thoughts and actions organzied.
How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
In such places, such as studies, or producing a project implementing something similar could be vital and support my growth both academically and personally. As I would always have a plan and I would have know a plan and know what I had done previously. This will monitor my growth and plan how I am going to grow.
